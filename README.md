## Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial security. This project employs supervised learning to detect potentially fraudulent transactions based on historical data, using features like transaction time, amount, and anonymized attributes.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing anonymized credit card transactions, with labels identifying fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Size**: Approximately 284,807 transactions, with 492 labeled as fraud.
- **Features**: `Time`, `Amount`, and anonymized variables `V1` through `V28`.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/madhavagopi1212/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

# Change to the project directory
cd credit-card-fraud-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place the dataset in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the main notebook or script to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.

```bash
# Run Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook credit-card-fraud-detection.ipynb
# or run Python script
python train_model.py
```

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is normalized and scaled, and class imbalance is addressed using techniques like undersampling or SMOTE to balance fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifies and uses the most relevant features for better model accuracy.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluates multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to determine the best performance.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The model is assessed using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, with a focus on Recall to ensure a higher rate of fraud detection.

## Results
The final model’s performance metrics are as follows:

- **Accuracy**: X%
- **Recall**: Y%
- **Precision**: Z%
- **F1 Score**: W%

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Future Improvements
Potential future enhancements to this project include:
- **Real-Time Detection**: Integrating the model with real-time data processing to immediately detect suspicious transactions.
- **Advanced Model Tuning**: Experimenting with other algorithms or tuning hyperparameters further to optimize performance.
- **Explainability Tools**: Utilizing tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to make model predictions more interpretable.
